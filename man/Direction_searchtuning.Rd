\arguments{
\item{Xc}{Design matrix, of dimension nvar(\eqn{n})xnobs(\eqn{p})}

\item{loading}{observation vector in the linear functional, of length \eqn{p}}

\item{mu}{Tuning parameter in construction of projection direction}

\item{resol}{Resolution or the factor by which \code{mu} is increased/decreased to obtain the smallest \code{mu}
that gives convergence of the optimization problem for constructing the projection direction}

that gives convergence of the optimization problem for constructing the projection direction}
}
